# Baka RSS
Why doesn't [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/index.html) have an rss feed of JUST the manga you are reading? Well now it can. with the help of [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). 

## Instructions
_1. Download XAMPP/Decide how to run this._
Technically, you do not need XAMPP for this to work. Any way you get PHP to run via an IP address will work, you just may have to edit 'settings.xml' directly later on.

Just download XAMPP for simplicities sake. The rest of these instructions assume so.

_2. Using XAMPP_
Find 'Apache Web Server' and start it. That's all. You may also want to lookup how to have XAMPP automatically start with your computer.

_3. Download Baka RSS_
Click on the 'Code' button on the top right of this webpage. Then click on 'Download ZIP'. Then extract it's contents to the 'htdocs' folder. For windows, this is most likely at 'c:xampp/htdoc'.

_4. Setting up MangaUpdates_
Set up an account on [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/index.html) and have a Reading list. MAKE SURE YOUR LIST IS PUBLIC and copy down that public url. It is something of the form 'https://www.mangaupdates.com/mylist.html?id=xxxxxx&list=read'.
